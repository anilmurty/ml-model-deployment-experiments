# Anil's ML Model Deployment Experiments

Hello! - thanks for checking out this repo. I made this to store any notes from my experiments in trying to deploy popular ML models to various compute platforms (public clouds, Akash Network or other)

## Organization

Root
 - <ML Model>
   - <Version>
     - <Cloud PLatform>
       - <README.md>
     
e.g stable-diffusionv1 on google cloud is under ../stable-diffusion/v1/gcp/README.md

Enjoy!
