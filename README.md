# Anil's ML Model Deployment Experiments

Hello! - thanks for checking out this repo. I made this to store any notes from my experiments in trying to deploy popular ML models to various compute platforms (public clouds, Akash Network or other)

## Organization

Root | ML Model | Version | Cloud PLatform | README
     
e.g Stable Diffusion V2 deployed on Google Cloud is under ../stable-diffusion/v1/gcp/README.md

Enjoy!
